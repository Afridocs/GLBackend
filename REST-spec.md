# Summary

This is a breif summary of the REST API specification.

## Public API

### API accessible at all users

`/node/`

Returns information on the GlobaLeaks node. This includes
submission paramters and how information should be presented
by the client side application.

`/submission`

This creates an empty submission and returns the ID
to be used when referencing it as a whistleblower.
ID is a random 64bit integer (POST only)

`/submission/<submission_id>`

Returns the currently submitted fields and material filenames and size, this
is the only interface giving back the complete submission status (GET only)

`/submission/<submission_id>/submit_fields`

does the submission of the fields that are supported by
the node in question and update the selected submission_id (POST only)

`/submission/<submission_id>/add_group`

adds a group to the list of recipients for the selected
submission. group are addressed by their ID (POST only)

`/submission/<submission_id>/finalize`

completes the submission in progress, **give to the server the receipt secret**
and confirm the receipt (or answer with a part of them). settings dependent.
(POST only)

`/submission/<submission_id>/upload_file`

upload a file to the selected submission_id (PUT only)

### API shared between WhistleBlowers and Receiver (require auth)

`/tip/<string auth t_id>`

Returns the content of the submission with the specified ID.
Inside of the request headers, if supported, the password for accessing
the tip can be passed. This returns a session token that is then
used for all future requests to be authenticated. supports
GET (all status data), POST (comment and pertinence), DELETE tip (if 
permitted by configuration)

`/tip/<string t_id>/add_comment`

Both WB and Receiver can write a comment in a Tip (POST only)

### tip subsection API (WhistleBlower only)

`/tip/<string t_id>/update_file`

Update material available for download, a new material has resetted 
counter for download limits. 
The material is published when 'finalized'. (PUT, GET, DELETE)

`/tip/<string t_id>/finalize_update`

Used to add a description in the uploaded files. 
This action make the new uploaded data available for download. 
If this action is missed, the material can be published after a timeout expiring 
at midnight (MAY BE REVIEWED) (POST only)

### tip subsection (API Receivers only)

`/tip/<string t_id>/download_material`

This interface can be disabled by delivery configuration.

used to download the material from the
submission. if a download limit has been configured, can be requested
only if relative download count is < max_downloads (POST only).

Paramters inside the POST specify which Material Set and the requested
mode (compressed, encrypted)

`/tip/<string t_id>/pertinence`

This interface can be disabled by administrative settings.
express a pertinence value (-1 or +1, True/False) (POST only)

## Receiver API

`/receiver/<string t_id>/overview`

Brief summary of all related Tip, and personal settings customizable by
the receiver.

## Admin API

`/admin/receivers/`

Interact with the current receivers list, the GET is supported and 
not intended to be redoundand with GET /node/, because maybe the 
public output shall be different from the admin capability of view (GET, POST)

`/admin/node`

For configuring the *public* details of the node, the private details are
set in the specific resources

`/admin/delivery`
`/admin/notification`

For setting up delivery and notification modules. perform host dependent
configuration.

`/admin/storage`
`/admin/filtering`

For setting up storage technology, implemented by an extensible class.
and for configuring filtering policies, implemented by extensible class.

# Data Object involved

file descriptor, every completed file upload is always stored and represented with this dict:

    { filename: <string>, comment: <String>, size: <Int, in bytes>, content-type: <string> }

<LocaLDict>, the Local Dict is an object used to store localized texts, in example:

    { 'IT' : 'Sono io, Mario!' },
    { 'EN' : 'Mario am I!' },
    { 'FR' : 'je suis Mario!' }


<RDict>, an object of boolean values, expressing the permissions given to a receiver, 
         They need to be specified separately. Possible permissions can be:
         . can delete a submission (not just a Tip)
         . can postopone expiration date
         . can configure his own notification settings
         . can configure his own delivery settings

<NDict>, an object of booleand values, expressing the properties of the node,
         They need to be specified separately.
         Those properties likey can be communicated to an external directory 
         (LeakDirectory) and express the safety, the features and the reliability
         of a GL node. 
         Possible properties can be:
         . end to end encryption enforced,
         . are receivers part of the admin group ?
         . anonymity enforced ?
         . are the receivers identity published ?

<ModuleDataStruct>
<ModuleAdminConf>

<ModleDataStruct> and <ModuleAdminConfig> are basically the same object,
(implemented in globaleaks/core/datatypes.py) object of ModuleConf.
ModuleConf objects are JSON description useful to present at the user
(admin or recever) the amount of available field. Those objects can be
filled properly, verified and accepted by the extension plugin. 

the fields that NEED to be present in the json struct, 
object ModuleAdminConf, are:

    The data sets by administrator:

    [ 'name': <String, the short name of the module>, 
      'activate': <Bool, the admin selection of enable the module or not>, 
      'receiver-disable': <Bool, can the receiver disable this module ?>,
      'service-message': <String, the short description of the message, or hiht about the activation and options>
        # optional
      'options': <Json object with empty field or default values>,
    ]

IF the admin has activate the module and 
IF the admin permit the receiver to enable/disable the module
IF the module supports receiver options,

then a new ModuleConf object would be used, and is called ModuleDataStruct,
contains the 'activate' field with a default set in the module, and the options
available for the receiver.

ModuleAdminConfig is used in the REST of /admin/* path, ModuleDataStruct in /receiver/*

value making enable|disale module, and the entire HTML FORM expected to be 
filled, or already filled).
These interface has been separated from the next (storage and filtering) 
because notification & delivery shall contain receiver interaction and
selection, therefore has been splitted to easily support further changes.
